# 74hc-uart
In this project, you can find a schematics and descriptions for an asynchronous serial transmitter and receiver with 74hcxxx ICs. The circuits can be used for diy and old cpus where there is no support for UART, or you can just check the schematics to get an idea how an UART could be implemented in microcontrollers. It could be useful for VHDL designs.

## Transmitter
You can find the schematics and a detailed description of the serial transmitter in the ./hardware/transmitter folder.

## Receiver
Coming soon!
